# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8 on CPU

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements **real-time object detection** using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV** on a CPU. 
It captures live video, runs object detection, and displays results with bounding boxes.


## 🎯 Features
✅ Uses **YOLOv8** pretrained model for **object detection**  
✅ Works on **CPU** (optimized for performance)  
✅ Supports **live webcam detection**  
✅ Modular code structure  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
